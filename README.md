# CCTV Based Litter Detection
### IEDC TechXcel Challange

We used [Yolov8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) for training our models:
We used the [UAVVase](https://github.com/PUTvision/UAVVaste) as the dataset

## Results
We had not any access to computing powers so the outputs are not accurate yet.

### YOLOv8n 50 Epochs
#### Without any threshold

#### With threshold, and highest confidence
